I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The Pieces enum class.
*       we define the enum class for each piece, the reason it is best because we define two level in the String [].
*       then it eaiser to find if it is first level and second level.

* The method reset in class StepsGame.
* 

I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* The idea of <> came from a discussion with <...>

* The code in class <...> uses an idea suggested by <...>
