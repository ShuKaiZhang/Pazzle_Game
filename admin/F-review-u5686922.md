Review Comments:

Ps: due to the restructure of whole assignment, the D2E_test is deleted. 

Generally, Those code written by Zhuangzhuang is easy to read and clear. Zhuangzhaung and I worked on Piece.java together, and Zhuangzhuang restructures and improves the whole assignment except JavaFX.
Most of those codes is use the appropriate name to define the variable and method to improve the readability.


Piece.java: 18-118 rows use the multi-dimension to define this 8 piece, which is easier to do the calculus and find the solution.
Piece.java: 159-219 rows defined the orientation of piece by two methods instead of a redundant 64 pieces coding. Ps: I also take part in part of the original code.
Piece.java: 222-250 rows is a test, make piece visualized in the console if it prints.

Position class define the 'ontop' (confirm the first level)and 'engage' ( the pegs is engaged by this piece.)

Stephanie: task 2,3,5,6 is finished by Zhuangzhuang, and we did the task 5 together.
