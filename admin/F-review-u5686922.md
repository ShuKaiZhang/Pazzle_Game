Review Comments:

Ps: due to the restructure of whole assignment, the D2E_test is deleted. 

Generally, Those code written by Zhuangzhuang is easy to read and clear. Zhuangzhaung and me worked on Piece.java together, and Zhuangzhuang restructure and improve the whole assignment except javafx.
Most of his code are use appropriate name to define the variable and method to improve the readability.


Piece.java: 18-118 rows use the multi dimension to define these 8 piese, which is easier to do the calculus and find the solution.
Piece.java: 159-219 rows defined the orientation of piece by two method instead of a redundant 64 pieces coding. Ps: I also take part in part of the original code.
Piece.java: 222-250 rows is a test, make piece visualised in console if it print.

Position class define the 'ontop' (confirm the first level)and 'engage' ( the pegs is engage by this piece.)

StepGame: task 2,3,5,6 is finished by Zhuangzhuang, and we did the task 5 together.
