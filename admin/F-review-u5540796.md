Review Comments:


Generally, all javafx coding is did by kai so far, the code is highly readability, 
The class Board is specific, He satisfied the rule and letstructures visualized.

Board.java: 30-47 rows draw the dots on the board.

Board.java: 51-60 and 195-207 rows set the images on the board.

Board.java: 67-121 rows are event handler.

Board.java: 126-192 rows are checking, movement and setting functions. 
This part is the most important part in Board.java. he applied task 5 function and check if the pieces on the board valid. 


task 4 and 7 are done by Shukai, and we discussed the task 5 .
